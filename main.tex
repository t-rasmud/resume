\section{Research Projects}
\cvlistitem{Created a runtime analysis that identifies liveness bugs in distributed systems. The analysis detected repeating states in a given execution trace that violated a liveness property. 
Several features of the tool were designed with the aim of keeping the runtime overheads at a minimum.
The tool identified real bugs in production code like Microsoft Azure storage vNext System. }
\cvlistitem{Implemented a dynamic data race detector for programs written in P\#, a DSL for developing and testing asynchronous systems
using the happens before algorithm. I tracked all runtime memory reads and writes with the help of Extended Reflection, a library that facilitates dynamic instrumentation by inserting callbacks for MSIL instructions.}
\cvlistitem{Designed and built a profiler that tracks the precise data path taken by objects in Java programs. I implemented
this tool in Java on top of the Calfuzzer/Soot framework. This tool helped identify performance issues caused by memory bloat 
in several Java programs. Fixing these issues significantly improved the performance of the programs under test.}
%\cvlistitem{Built an incremental static analyzer on top of SATURN, a constraint based
%static analysis tool for finding bugs. Implementation was done in OCaml and Berkeley DB.}

\section{Graduate Course Projects}
\cvlistitem{Built an interactive data visualization tool in d3 that summarizes the relationship between pairs
of genome structures as part of a three member team.}
\cvlistitem{Built a code search tool that matches a given input query on the parse tree of the source code.
This was done in a team of three.}
\cvlistitem{Implemented a static null pointer dereference analysis tool for Java programs using the
Soot bytecode analysis framework.}

%\section{Graduate Courses}
%\cvitem{}{Concepts of Programming Languages, Software Engineering, Data Visualization, Program analysis and verification, 
%Computer Systems, Design and analysis of algorithms, Automata theory and
%computability, Topics in software bug detection, Automated verification.}

\section{Awards and Scholarships}

\cvlistitem{Received the PLMW scholarship for attending POPL 2015.}
%\cvlistitem{Secured 99.7 percentile in Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) 2012.}
